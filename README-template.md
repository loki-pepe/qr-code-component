### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Learn web development by web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) - Their courses on HTML and CSS helped me refresh my basic knowledge and reinforced in me the idea to use semantic HTML elements instead of generic elements coupled with a myriad of classes, which helped both the work process and code readability
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - An extensive source on everything HTML and CSS
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - While searching for answers to very specific questions, Stack Overflow helped me resolve some dilemmas and shed some light on encountered problems.
